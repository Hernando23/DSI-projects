### Project 2 - Regression and Classification with the Ames Housing Data

This project is based on data from [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), containing 79 features describing residential properties in Ames, Iowa.

After cleaning the dataset, creating visualizations and examining potential correlations between features in the EDA phase, the next step was to predict the price of the houses with Linear Regression using only fixed characteristics of the properties.

In the second part of the project we have used non-fixed characteristics of the properties, together with residuals from the first Linear Regression to explain any remaining variance in the price.

The last part of the project focused on predicting 'abnormal' category of sales, using Logistic Regression.
